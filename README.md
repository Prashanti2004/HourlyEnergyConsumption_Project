# ðŸ”‹ Hourly Energy Consumption Analysis

This project provides a detailed time-series analysis of **hourly energy consumption**, uncovering patterns in electricity demand throughout the day and across various time periods. Built using **Python and Jupyter Notebook**, the notebook offers visual insights and interpretable metrics to support data-driven decisions in energy optimization, smart grid development, and sustainability strategies.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze energy consumption at an **hourly granularity**
- Discover **peak vs off-peak usage** trends
- Visualize temporal consumption patterns (daily, weekly, seasonal)
- Build a foundation for future **forecasting models**

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- Time-indexed data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Aggregated visual insights (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly)
- Heatmaps, line plots, and statistical summaries
- Modular notebook design for easy experimentation or extension

---

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

---

## ðŸ§  Use Cases

- **Utility providers:** Optimize load balancing and peak scheduling  
- **Energy researchers:** Model demand-response systems  
- **Data scientists:** Prototype consumption forecasting algorithms  
- **Students:** Learn time-series analysis using real-world energy data

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source:** [Provide source link if public, or describe it briefly]  
- **Format:** CSV / Time-series  
- **Fields:** DateTime, Hour, Energy Consumption
